* travel is expensive, need money
* depressed when going back home bc no more money
* shovelling allows to cope with depression -> 12 startups in 12 months
* nomad list was a shared spreadsheet by mistake, now big website, crowdsourced, now 20k/month
* from nomadlist bootstrapped remoteok, 10k/month

* framework:
    * have idea, build it, launch it, grow it, monetise it, automate it, exit
* idea
    * has to focus on problem you have
    * having the problem yourself makes you an expert in it
    * go do crazy, original things to cross cultures and become original yourself
    * make an idea list
    * do it yourself. learn to code, etc.
    * idea x execution = business
* build
    * learn to code
    * typeform, no code required to build form and receive payments
    * max 1 month for prototype. need to learn by lauching
* launch
    * most important step, get users and validate
    * producthunt => very important, time to launch is important
    * talk with people. be honest, don't be marketing
    * hackernews is very critical but good too
    * reddit is very big. mainstream launching platform. no spam, no marketing, be honest
        * find good subreddits
        * might make it to frontpage. careful about load from fp
    * go to niche forums and other discussion boards
* grow
    * traffic will drop after first spike of traffic
    * non organic traffic doesn't work. don't do it.
    * organic growth == people actually like your website
    * don't pay for ads, everybody has ad blocker and traffic phases out when you stop buying ads
    * organic is harder but better. if you dont get traffic means your product is not good enough
    * get feedback from users and build with them, users will become ambassadors
    * use email list for reengagement. Don't spam
    * build your startup in public, live stream. trendy and very efficient
    * keep launching
* monetise
    * get the first dollars asap
    * sell something, or patreon
    * can get money first to gauge interest
    * subscription, to allow compounding income
* automate
    * anywhere from 180-700 robots doing regular tasks
* exit
    * important to be able to move on
