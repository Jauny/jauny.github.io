Raw Kindle notes for [The Man Who Tapped The Secrets Of The Universe by Glenn Clark](http://a.co/aV6j5Sp)


I believe that mediocrity is self-inflicted and that genius is self bestowed. Every successful man I ever have known, and I have known a great many, carries with him the key which unlocks that awareness and lets in the universal power that has made him into a master."  

"That key is desire when it is released into the great eternal Energy of the universe."  

Every successful man or great genius has three particular qualities in common. The most conspicuous of these is that they all produce a prodigious amount of work. The second is that they never know fatigue, and the third is that their minds grow more brilliant as they grow older, instead of less brilliant. Great men's lives begin at forty, where the mediocre man's life ends.  

The genius remains an ever-flowing fountain of creative achievement until the very last breath he draws.  

An inner joyousness, amounting to ecstasy, is the normal condition of the genius mind. Any lack of that joyousness develops body-destroying toxins. That inner ecstasy of the mind is the secret fountain of perpetual youth and strength in any man. He who finds it finds omnipotence and omniscience.  

wealth may be more of a handicap than a help because the comforts and luxuries it can give sidetrack one's desire for a successful life and develop instead a desire for ease.  

every man should be master of anything he does and should do it in a masterly manner, with love, no matter what it is, whether hard physical work, menial or boring work, or inspirational work.  

No great man has ever wise-cracked his way into greatness. Until one learns to lose one's self he cannot find himself. No one can multiply himself by himself. He must first divide himself and give himself to the service of all, thus placing himself within all others through acts of thoughtfulness and service.  

If you always look toward the visible product, you merely look toward the effects of cause. If you look reverently in the inward direction toward your inner self, you will be amazed at what you will find.  

"Inspiration comes only to those who seek it with humility toward their own achievements and reverence toward the achievements of God. With love of your work, love of life, and reverence for the universal force which gives you unlimited power for the asking, you may sit on the top of the world if you desire to sit there.  

The only way you can find it is through being alone with your thoughts at sufficiently long intervals to give that inner voice within you a chance to cry out in distinguishable language to you, 'Here I am within you.'  

"And how does one make that transformation within? A deep and genuine purpose.  

The great composers, sculptors, painters, inventors, and planners of all time were in such an ecstatic condition during their intensive creating hours that the million petty trivialities which short-circuit the energy and waste the time of most men never found an opportunity for even entering their consciousness. From this high mental state of ecstasy down to the simple state of what we might call just happiness or enthusiasm, you can construct a thought-power pressure gauge in which you can see that pressure rise or fall.  

"He who cultivates that quiet, unobtrusive ecstasy of inner joyousness can scale any heights and be a leader in his field, no matter what that field is. He who never finds it must be content to follow in the footsteps of those who do, and thus be self-condemned for life to obscurity.  

The Life Triumphant is that which places what a man gives to the world in creative expression far ahead of that which he takes from it of the creations of others.
