title: Anti Pattern - ES6 default exports

The new ES6 module system offers a built in export system coming with a better syntax than previously used CommonJS and AMD modules.  

You can now export modules with the following syntax:  

```javascript
class Foo {}
export default Foo;
```

And then import this module from another file with:  

```javascript
import Foo from './foo';
```

If you need to import more things for this module, the syntax would be different:  

```javascript
import Foo, {Bar, Baz} from './foo';
```

Because `Foo` is the default export, the import can happen with an implicit different name:  

```javascript
import MyFoo from './foo';
```

As code grows, this becomes an issue as the relation between `MyFoo` and `Foo` is unclear. Even if engineers are diligent in using the same name, a refactor renaming the original module might miss some places when it's imported and this issue would appear.  


Instead, never export modules as default:  

```javascript
class Foo {}
export Foo;
```

and import them as normal modules:  

```javascript
import {Foo} from './foo';
```

If a different name is required, then the renaming is explicit:  

```javascript
import {Foo as MyFoo} from './foo';
```

I just went into a cleanup to remove all default exports on one of our codebase, and just that proved useful and made the code cleaner and safer.
