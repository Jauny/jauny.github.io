|![Docker image](/assets/images/docker-image.png) image|Lightweight, executable snapshop of an application to run. Holds code, env, libs, runtime, config files, etc.|
|![Docker Container](/assets/images/docker-container.png) container|Executed, running image. Runs completely isolated from host environment.|
|![Docker Kernel](/assets/images/docker-kernel.png) Kernel|One Docker Kernel per host. It's a layer between containers and Host OS, that allows containers to run natively.|
|![Docker Service](/assets/images/docker-service.png) Service|A service runs multiple replicas of a container. Handles load balancing, sclaing, etc, in prod. In that contaxt, a container is called a `task`.|
|![Docker App](/assets/images/docker-app.png) App|It's a swarm. Manages multiple services and how they interact between each other. Docker-managed SoA in a way.|
|![Docker Swarm](/assets/images/docker-swarm.png) Swarm Group|Group of machines (physical or virtual) -called nodes- running multiple apps in a cluster. `Swarm Manager` is 1 machine controlling the others (send commands etc).|
